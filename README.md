# DimensionalReductionTechniques

This repository contains the python notebooks of various Dimensional Reduction Techniques.

1. <a href='https://github.com/dsharmabtg/DimensionalReductionTechniques/tree/master/Locally%20Linear%20Embedding'>Locally Linear Embedding</a> provides the hands-on tutorial on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) on crab dataset.
    * **About Dataset:** Campbell studied rock crabs in the genus "Leptograpsus" in 1974. One species, Leptograpsus variegatus, had split into two new species,previously grouped by color (orange and blue). Preserved specimens lose their color, so it was hoped that the morphological differences would allow the museum material to be classified. Data are available on 50 specimens of each sex of each species (200 total), collected in Fremantle, Western Australia. Each specimen has measurements on: the frontal lobe width (FL), the rear width (RW), the length along the midline of the carapace (CL), the maximum width of the carapace (CW), and the depth body length (BD) in mm, plus the color (in other words, the species) and the sex. The exploratory analysis about the dataset can be find <a href='https://github.com/dsharmabtg/DimensionalReductionTechniques/blob/master/Locally%20Linear%20Embedding/01.Introduction_to_the_Dataset.ipynb'>here</a>.
